First you can run “oc get mcp” to show your current list of MCPs:

[source,bash]
----
# oc get mcp

----

List out all of your nodes:

[source,bash]
----
# oc get no

----
Determine, from the above suggestions, how you would like to separate out your worker nodes into machine config pools
(MCP). +
In this example we will just use 1 node in each MCP. +
We first need to label the nodes so that they can be put into MCPs. We will do this with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
oc label node euschannel-worker-0.test.corp node-role.kubernetes.io/*mcp-1*=

----

This will show up when you run the “oc get node” command:

[source,bash]
----
# oc get no

----

Now you need to create yaml files that will apply the labels as MCPs. Here is one example:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1

----

For each of these, just run “oc apply -f {filename.yaml}”:

[source,bash]
----
# oc apply -f test-mcp-2.yaml

----

Now you can run “oc get mcp” again and your new MCPs will show. Please note that you will still see the original worker
and master MCPs that are part of the cluster.

[source,bash]
----
# oc get mcp

----
