= OCP API Compatibility Policy

:profile: core-lcm-lab

The most important thing to understand when considering which Z-release to upgrade to inside of a new Y-release is what 
patches need to be in the new Z-release. In other words if you are currently at OCP 4.11.28 you will need to make sure 
to upgrade to a Z-release of 4.12 that has all of the patches in it that were applied to 4.11.28, otherwise you will 
break the built-in compatibility of Kubernetes. +
This is called the Kubernetes version skew policy and can be found at: https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy[https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy]  +
This can also be seen in the following graphic:

Please also note that not all releases of OCP can be upgraded to any arbitrary Z-release even if they contain all of 
the required patches. You can use the upgrade graph tool (https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpupgradegraph/update_path[https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpupgradegraph/update_path]) 
to determine if the path is valid for your z-release. You should also always verify with your Sales Engineer or 
Technical Account Manager at Red Hat to make sure the upgrade path is valid for Telco implementations.
